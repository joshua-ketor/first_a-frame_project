# Project README

## Description
This project is a 3D scene created using A-Frame, a web framework for building virtual reality experiences. The scene consists of various elements such as a sky, platform, pillars, walls, ground, table, chairs, and objects on the table.

## Table Setup
To create the table setup, follow these steps:
1. Place a minimum of two (2) chairs around the table.
2. On the table, place a MiLo Tin, a Milk Tin, and 2 cups.

## File Structure
The project files are organized as follows:
- `index.html`: The HTML file representing the 3D scene created using A-Frame.
- `txtures/`: The directory containing the textures used for different elements in the scene.
- `scripts/`: The directory containing the a-frame library file.

## Usage
To view the 3D scene, open the `index.html` file in a web browser that supports A-Frame and WebGL.

## Acknowledgements
